                        <li><b>Floating Structure:</b> There's a myth that the Golden Temple is a floating structure because it appears to float on the Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar) surrounding it. However, the temple is built on a concrete platform in the center of the sarovar, giving it the illusion of floating.</li>
                        <li><b>Underground Treasure:</b> Some myths suggest that there are hidden treasures buried beneath the Golden Temple, including gold and precious jewels. However, there's no evidence to support these claims, and the temple's wealth primarily comes from donations made by devotees.</li>
                        <li><b>Healing Powers:</b> It's often believed that the waters from the Amrit Sarovar have healing properties and can cure various ailments. While the sarovar is considered sacred by Sikhs, any perceived healing effects are likely attributed to faith rather than supernatural powers.</li>
                        <li><b>Guardian Spirits:</b> Like many religious sites, there are myths about the Golden Temple being guarded by divine spirits or celestial beings. However, there's no substantial evidence to support these claims, and the temple complex is primarily a place of worship and reflection.</li>
                        <li><b>Predictions of Future Events:</b> Some myths suggest that the architecture and design of the Golden Temple contain hidden messages or predictions about future events. However, these claims are unsubstantiated and not supported by any credible evidence.</li>
