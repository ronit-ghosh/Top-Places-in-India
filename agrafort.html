                        <li><b>Inescapable Prison:</b> There's a myth that the Agra Fort contained an inescapable prison where prisoners were kept without any chance of escape. While the fort did have prison cells, there's no evidence to suggest that they were inescapable.</li>
                        <li><b>Haunted by Spirits:</b> Similar to many historical forts, there are myths about Agra Fort being haunted by the spirits of past rulers, soldiers, or prisoners. However, there's no substantial evidence to support these claims.</li>
                        <li><b>Underground Tunnels:</b> Some myths suggest that Agra Fort has secret underground tunnels that were used by the Mughal rulers for escape or other purposes. However, no such tunnels have been discovered or confirmed.</li>
                        <li><b>Hidden Treasures:</b> Some myths suggest that Agra Fort houses hidden treasures, including gold, jewels, and other valuables. Despite various searches, no significant treasures have been found within the fort.</li>
                        <li><b>Curse of Shah Jahan:</b> It's sometimes believed that Agra Fort is cursed because Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned there by his son Aurangzeb, spent his last years gazing at the Taj Mahal, the mausoleum of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. However, there's no historical evidence to support such a curse.</li>
