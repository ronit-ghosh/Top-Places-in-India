                        <li><b>Inescapable Prison:</b> There's a myth that the Red Fort housed a prison where countless prisoners were held captive, tortured, and executed. While the fort did have some areas designated for confinement, it was primarily a royal residence and administrative center rather than a large-scale prison.</li>
                        <li><b>Treasure Vaults:</b> Some myths suggest that the Red Fort contains hidden treasure vaults filled with gold, jewels, and other valuable artifacts. However, despite various searches and excavations, no significant treasures have been found within the fort's premises.</li>
                        <li><b>Haunted Fort:</b> Like many historical landmarks, there are myths about the Red Fort being haunted by the spirits of past rulers or prisoners. However, there's no substantial evidence to support these claims, and the fort is primarily a tourist attraction and cultural heritage site.</li>
                        <li><b>Mystical Powers:</b> There are myths about the Red Fort possessing mystical powers or divine protection, which shielded it from enemy invasions and natural disasters. However, the fort's defenses were primarily based on strategic military planning and architectural design rather than supernatural forces.</li>
                        <li><b>Cursed Monument:</b> Some myths suggest that the Red Fort is cursed due to the tragedies and misfortunes associated with its construction and history. However, there's no historical evidence to suggest such a curse, and the fort remains an iconic symbol of India's rich cultural heritage.</li>
