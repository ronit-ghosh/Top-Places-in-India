                        <li><b>Eternal Flame:</b> There's a myth that an eternal flame burns under the India Gate, symbolizing the sacrifice of Indian soldiers. However, there is no eternal flame at India Gate. The Amar Jawan Jyoti, or Flame of the Immortal Soldier, is located at the India Gate War Memorial nearby.</li>
                        <li><b>Names of Soldiers:</b> It's often believed that the names of all Indian soldiers who lost their lives in World War I are inscribed on India Gate. However, India Gate primarily commemorates soldiers who fought and died in the First World War, but their names are not individually inscribed on the monument.</li>
                        <li><b>British Victory Monument:</b> Some myths suggest that India Gate was built by the British to celebrate their victory in World War I. However, India Gate was built as a memorial to honor the Indian soldiers who lost their lives during the war.</li>
                        <li><b>Haunted Monument:</b> Like many historical landmarks, there are myths about India Gate being haunted by the spirits of soldiers who died in battle. However, there's no substantial evidence to support these claims.</li>
                        <li><b>Underground Tunnels:</b> Some myths suggest that India Gate has secret underground tunnels or chambers. However, no such tunnels or chambers have been discovered or confirmed.</li>
